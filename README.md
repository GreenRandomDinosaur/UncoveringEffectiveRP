# UncoveringEffectiveRP

We provide the sample code for the paper ‘Uncovering the Effectiveness of Random Pruning at Initialization’. \\
Using this code, the mixture score distributions for important and random weights can be plotted, respectively, as shown in Figure 9. \\

To obtain the statistics, please refer to the code in 'sh_score_set.sh'. \\
To plot the results based on the obtained statistics, please refer to the code in 'sh_plot_score_hist_set.sh'. \\

Our implementation is based on the implementation of Wang et al. [1], which we appreciate them sharing. \\
